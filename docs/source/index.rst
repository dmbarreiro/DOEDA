DOEDA's documentation!
======================

Design of Experiments Database, or DOEDA, is a database that gathers information about experiments that were performed using an experimental design.
The main goal of DOEDA is to provide a central interface to easily access all experiments.

Each experiment in the database is stored as an 'experiment file', 
that contains information about the experiment such as the title, a description, the source,
the design and the data.
A full list of all the attributes present in an experiment file is available in the 'Experiment' section.

In order to easily sort the expriment using their characteristics, 
each experiment is also given a few keywords to identify its characteristics.
The list of all the keywords and their definition is presented in the 'Glossary' section.
